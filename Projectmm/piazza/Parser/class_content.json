We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\n2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors\u2019 answer</b> for instructors).\n\n3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>\n\nClick the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>.

This is much more than simply saying that something is known by all, but also implies that the fact that it is known is also known by all, etc. Consider a simple example of two allied armies situated on opposite hilltops waiting to attack their foe. Neither commander will attack unless he is sure that the other will attack at exactly the same time. The first commander sends a messenger to the other hilltop with the message &#34;I plan to attack in the morning.&#34; The messenger&#39;s journey is perilous and he may die on the way to delivering the message. If he gets to the other hilltop and informs the other commander - can we be certain that both will attack in the morning? Note that both commanders now know the message, but the first cannot be sure that the second got the message. Thus, common knowledge implies not only that both know some piece of information, but can also be absolutely confident that the rest know it, and that the rest know that we know it, and so on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(source:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html\">http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html</a>)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:&#34;helvetica&#34;,&#34;arial&#34;,sans-serif;background-color:#ccf\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>","bucket_order":3,"config":{},"updated":"2015-01-14T14:11:59Z","bucket_name":"Yesterday","uid":"gy7ge1n13jj47j","no_upvotes":0}],"id":"i4wmaidd1mh39","config":{},"history":[{"created":"2015-01-14T11:20:42Z","anon":"no","subject":"Common Knowledge","content":"<p>Consider this interesting puzzle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is a planet on which only red-eyed and blue-eyed creatures live. They is\u00a0no mode of communication between\u00a0them and there are no reflecting surfaces on the planet.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0they can not know the color of their eyes until they are able to logically deduce it with absolute surety. However, every creature can see the color of every other creature&#39;s eyes. A fairy visits the planet every night and takes along any red-eyed creature which has logically deduced that it is indeed red-eyed. Suppose there are 100 red-eyed creatures on the planet. One fine day all the creatures assemble near a hill, where the\u00a0green-eyed God of the planet\u00a0lives. From the hill he\u00a0makes an announcement - &#34;I see atleast one red-eyed person&#34;.

And if the other red-eyed creature had been the only red-eyed creature, then, it would have left on the very first night. Hence. both the red-eyed creatures depart from the planet on the second night after the day the announcement was made.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Continuing this argument, we realize that there is a mass salvation on the hundredth night after the day the announcement was made.</p>","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"nr":6,"tags":["other","student"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-01-14T11:20:42Z","data":"i4wmaidhbb63a","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},{"type":"followup","anon":"no","when":"2015-01-14T14:11:59Z","to":"i4wmaidd1mh39","uid":"gy7ge1n13jj47j"},{"type":"feedback","anon":"no","when":"2015-01-15T08:13:28Z","to":"i4wmaidd1mh39","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"tag_good_arr":["i4tkrjjhv8hm6"],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[{"us":false,"name":"Kamal Nayan Goyal","admin":true,"email":"kng@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6","role":"ta","admin_permission":5,"photo":null},{"us":false,"name":"Parth verma","admin":false,"email":"parthverma19@gmail.com","facebook_id":null,"id":"i4w838u4jun4pq","role":"student","photo":"1426313929_35.png"},{"us":false,"name":"RAMIT HANSDA","admin":true,"email":"ramit.hansda@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"hznxpxbs3z23ks","role":"ta","admin_permission":5,"photo":"1421386627_35.png"}],"type":"note","folders":["hw1"],"status":"active","created":"2015-01-14T11:40:33Z","unique_views":66,"children":[{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-01-14T14:04:18Z","anon":"no","children":[{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-01-15T01:56:48Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i4xhl6s0gmq13","data":null,"subject":"<p>The question was to show that (AB, AB, ..., AB) is a strictly dominant strategy equilibrium.

Ensure that\u00a0the equilibrium strategy is the best response strategy\u00a0.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The utility function of player 1 attain the maxima when the distance between two points is\u00a0maximum, the obvious candidate (not necessarily unique) for this to achieve is distribution on corner points. Making the Player 2&#39;s strategy as playing on the center ( Proof 1). \u00a0</p>\n<p>We need to now find out among all probability distribution on corners is there a special class of distributions that are Nash equilibria. i.e. those which satisfy condition 2.</p>\n<p>Consider first that player 1 plays deterministically at any of the corner.

We can check that it is a Nash equilibria. (Proof 2), The key observation to be made here is the movement of equilibrium point when we change the probability mass of the points, any distribution of type $$(x/2,(1-x)/2 , x/2, (1-x)/2 ) 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 $$ is also a Mixed strategy nash equilibrium. As equilibrium point do not shift in these distributions towards any corner and hence the best response to equilibrium strategy profile\u00a0is the equilibrium strategy. Hence there are infinite Mixed strategy nash equilibria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proof1:</p>\n<p>Claim: If the player 2 do not play the center, there exists a\u00a0probability distribution on the corners which when played by player 1 breaks condition 1 for player 2.<br />Proof: The symmetric probability distribution on corners by player 1 forces player 2 to play symmetrically. if not, the the best response of player 1 to asymmetric play of player 2 will push the equilibrium point towards one corner which increases the expected distance and hence the utility of player 2 decreases. Among all simultaneous symmetric plays by both players\u00a0playing at the center\u00a0is the strategy\u00a0which maximizes the utility of player 2 hence the best response of player 2 is to play at center and that of player 1 is to play symmetrically on the corners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proof2:</p>\n<p>Claim: Each corner points when played by player 1 with equal probability (1/4 each) and player 2 playing the center point deterministically, is a Nash equilibrium.</p>\n<p>Proof: Best\u00a0response strategy for this equilibrium strategy $$s^*$$ should satisfy.</p>\n<p>$$u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i}^*) \\geq u_i(s_i,s_{-i}^*)  \\forall i \\in \\{1,2\\}$$</p>\n<p>Let us see for player 1 first, we need to calculate the expected utility for this game. let D be the length of diagonal of the square.</p>\n<p>$$1/4*d/2 &#43; 1/4*d/2 &#43; 1/4*d/2 &#43; 1/4*d/2 = d/2 \\geq p1*d/2 &#43;p2*d/2 &#43; p3*d/2 &#43; p4* d/2$$\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hence any value will work for player 1.</p>\n<p>Let ys look at the player 2&#39;s utility funciton,</p>\n<p>$$u_2(s_1^*, s_2^*) \\geq u_2(s_1^*, s_2^{&#39;})$$</p>\n<p>if player 2 plays any other point than center the expected utility decreases as,</p>\n<p>$$u_2(s_1^*,(x_2,y_2) )= 1/4 * [(1-x_2)^2 &#43; y_2^2 &#43;\n\n(1-y_2)^2 &#43; x_2^2 &#43; x_2^2&#43; y_2^2\n\n&#43; (1-x_2)^2 &#43; (1-y_2)^2]=x_2^2&#43; y_2^2-x_2-y_2&#43;1\n$$ this function has minima at $$x_2 =0.5 $$ and $$y_2=0.5$$ as the objective of player 2 is to minimize the distance this gives maximum utility to player 2, and hence the best response policy is the\u00a0equilibrium policy and hence this is a Nash equilibrium point. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>","uid":"hr3cj71aqhv1ej"}],"bucket_name":"Today"},{"type":"s_answer","folders":[],"created":"2015-02-04T14:03:42Z","tag_endorse":[{"us":false,"name":"Parth verma","admin":false,"email":"parthverma19@gmail.com","facebook_id":null,"id":"i4w838u4jun4pq","role":"student","photo":null}],"children":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"id":"i5qsd096e6g4ew","tag_endorse_arr":["i4w838u4jun4pq"],"bucket_order":2,"config":{},"history":[{"created":"2015-02-04T14:03:42Z","anon":"no","subject":"","content":"<p>In general, a game with uncountably infinite strategy sets will not necessarily have a\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium\">Nash equilibrium</a>\u00a0solution.

Nothing more could be asked for. But if the algorithm \u00a0belongs to a hard complexity class, e.g, NP Complete Class or NP Hard class, then literally, we are &#39;<tt>almost</tt>&#39; doomed. I am using the word &#39;<tt>almost</tt>&#39; , because after seeing the intractibility of the algorithm, I&#39;ll try to design an approximation algorithm for the above problem and try to come up with a suitable factor of Optimality under which I can bound the result of my approx algorithm. But if we&#39;re not able to come up with a good approximation for the problem then, we&#39;re finally doomed and the Mechanism is of no practical use.

He passes them to Player2, who trims two at most to create a three-way tie for largest in her eyes. She sets the trimmings aside and gives the five pieces to Player3, who trims one at most to create a two-way tie for largest in his eyes. Player4, now selects the piece she likes best. Choosing proceeds in the reverse order from cutting, with the proviso that anyone who trimmed one or more pieces must take one of them if any are still available when it&#39;s his or her turn to choose. The extra piece to begin with assures that no player gets second-best. If someone takes a piece she likes before it&#39;s her turn to choose, an equivalent piece or better always remains on the table. According to a formula that Brams and Taylor developed, Player1 must cut the cake into at least 2<sup>(<em>n</em>-2)</sup>\u00a0&#43;1 pieces at the start. This amounts to nine pieces for five players, 17 pieces for six, and so on. Player1 has to cut all these extra pieces to make sure that, when he finally gets to choose at the end, there will be a piece left that hasn&#39;t been either trimmed or chosen by one of the many other players.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Nature of equilibrium is BIC, as if some player is not truthful (i.e. if according to that player smaller portion is acceptable), then others will be benefited.</p>\n<p></p>","uid":"i4w838xik0z4pu"}],"nr":72,"tags":["hw1","student"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-03-21T15:56:42Z","data":"i7j77obuq22iv","uid":"i4w838xik0z4pu"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"question","folders":["hw1"],"status":"active","created":"2015-03-21T15:57:58Z","unique_views":2,"children":[{"type":"i_answer","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-21T16:38:25Z","tag_endorse":[],"children":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"id":"i7j8pb65uqb12u","tag_endorse_arr":[],"bucket_order":2,"config":{},"history":[{"created":"2015-03-21T16:38:25Z","anon":"no","subject":"","content":"<p>Just assume that whatever proportion of the cake a player wants to cut he can cut exactly that proportion accurately.</p>\n<p>So any mechanism which is both proportional division and envy-free division will lead to equal sharing only.<br />I mean if all players feel they got the biggest piece or atleast greater than 1/n of the cake, that means the cake was equally shared.</p>","uid":"hyskik5ch0s1x8"}],"bucket_name":"Today"}],"id":"i7j79asagxp3p8","no_answer":0,"config":{"feed_groups":"hyskik5ch0s1x8,i56t3eqe4lh2u2"},"history":[{"created":"2015-03-21T15:57:58Z","anon":"no","subject":"Assignment 1 - doubt","content":"<p>I have a doubt about the assignment question.

So the above mechanism is truthfully implementable in dominant strategies i.e. it is DSIC.</p>","uid":"i56t3eu05vv2u5"}],"nr":77,"tags":["other","student"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-03-21T16:57:37Z","data":"i7j9e0ajam53ka","uid":"i56t3eu05vv2u5"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["hw1"],"status":"active","created":"2015-03-21T17:08:50Z","unique_views":0,"children":[],"id":"i7j9sfdzjge4bp","config":{"feed_groups":"instr_i4tcy4uxm5i3sk,i4uql3quy7s1mv"},"history":[{"created":"2015-03-21T17:09:53Z","anon":"no","subject":"Assignment 1","content":"<p>Let the kids be Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

A mechanism that implements the desirable outcome</p>\n<p>of the three kids sharing the cake equally is as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. A cuts the cake into three pieces, according to what he thinks to be of the same sizes</p>\n<p>2. B has two choices:<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0i. Passing \u00a0 - if he thinks 2 or more pieces are tied for largest.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ii. Trimming - the largest piece so as to create a two-way tie for the largest, <br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and sets the trimmings aside. <br />3. C picks a piece, then B, and then A. If B has trimmed one piece in step 2, then B has to take that<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 trimmed piece if C did not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, the cake has been allocated either wholly or partly. Partly, in the case where B has trimmed one of<br />the piece and the trimming is set aside. Otherwise, it is wholly and we are done. In either case we need<br />to prove the allocation was envy-free.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 i. C chooses first, so the lack of envy is true of C.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ii. B made atleast 2 pieces which are tied for largest, and thus atleast one of them still remains<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0even after C chooses his piece.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 iii. A has made three pieces, according to what he thinks to be of the same sizes, by Steps 1-3 it <br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0is clear that out of the three one still remains.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If B has not trimmed any piece in Step 2, then the process is over. If not proceed as follows, let the kid, <br />who took the trimmed piece be denoted by T, and the other- among B and C - by NT. <br />4. To deal with the trimmings, NT cuts them into three pieces what he thinks to be of the same sizes.<br />5. The kids pick pieces in this order: T, A, NT.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now the entire cake has been allocated and the steps 4 and 5 again is envy-free. The key to this strategy<br />is that for the trimmings, A has an advantage with respect to T, since A will never envy T because, T got <br />the trimmed piece. And A can pick after T and before NT. And NT experiences no envy as he cuts the</p>\n<p>trimmings into 3 parts, according to what he thinks to be of the same sizes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Four or More\u00a0Kids</p>\n<p>-----------------------------</p>\n<p>For four or more kids, envy-free solutions becomes complex and may take arbitrarily long to resolve. <br />However, a general solution of the problem of fair, envy-free division was found by Steven Brams and <br />Alan Taylor.</p>\n<p>With four kids, the solution is as follows: the first kid, A, cuts the cake into five equal-looking pieces.</p>\n<p>He passes them to B, who trims at-most two, to create a three-way tie for largest in his eyes. He sets</p>\n<p>the trimmings aside and gives the five pieces to C, who trims at-most one to create a two-way tie <br />for largest in his eyes. D, the fourth kid, now selects the piece which he thinks is the best. Choosing <br />proceeds in the reverse order from cutting, with the condition that anyone who trimmed one or more</p>\n<p>pieces must take one of them if any are still available when it is his turn to choose. The extra piece to</p>\n<p>begin with assures that no kid gets second-best. If someone takes a piece that he likes before it is his</p>\n<p>turn to choose, an equivalent piece or better always remains.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the formula Brams and Taylor developed, in the general case of n kids, A must cut the</p>\n<p>cake into at least <em><strong>2 * (n - 2) &#43; 1</strong></em> pieces at the start and proceeds as mentioned in the above paragraph. <br />A has to cut all these extra pieces to make sure that, when he finally gets to choose at the end, there <br />will be a piece left that hasn&#39;t been either trimmed or chosen by one of the many other kids.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The equilibrium here is DSIC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>References:</em></p>\n<p>1.

This can be simply understood by the fact that if a child cuts the cake into a piece larger than his share (unlabelled/r), some one else will pick it up and he is doomed to get a smaller piece than his original share.

Now we have 3 players. A continuous mechanism can be used for the allocation of pieces as follows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">We have a cake and a knife. Now, the knife is moved from left most corner to right most corner. During this continuous movement, the player has give the signal (say\u00a0they use the word &#39;STOP&#39; or some alarm buzz)\u00a0to pause the knife\u00a0movement. Then that portion of cake is cut and immediately allocated to player whose delivers the signal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">So, now we are left with other larger piece of cake and 2 players. The approach\u00a0discussed in the\u00a0class can be used to allocate\u00a0pieces of cake to 2 players.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Let Fi be the function of fraction\u00a0pieces of cake</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A1, A2, A3 be the players</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">X1,X2,X3 be the pieces of cake.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">It can seen that F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)=1/3</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As the knife is moved from left to right the players may bid immediately or else other payers may bid for that, so</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">if x be the player who first delivers signal, then</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Fx(X1)=1/3.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Then for the other 2 players, the cake is split into 2 equal halves as seen in class. so,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)=1/3.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Generalisation for n players</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The same approach can be extended to the n players.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Say, there are n players. The knife is moved from left to right corner. When the first player gives the signal the piece is allocated to him. The same process is repeated again. The knife movement is started from left to right, the one who first delivers the signal first is allocated with the piece.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The process is repeated for n-1 times, then cake pieces are allocated for n-1 players and last piece is allocated for the left over player.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As, seen above for the 3 players, the same can be generalised for n players in a iterative way. Hence</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)........Fn(Xn)=1/n.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The equilibrium is DSIC(Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible).</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">No matter even if other players deviate from the equilibrium point, the player is guaranteed to get an incentive of at least <strong>1/n.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Let us assume some player &#39;i&#39; deviates and bids/signals when knife is less than 1/n point, still other players are guaranteed atleast &gt;=1/n.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Let us assume some players being greedy do not bid/signal at point 1/n. Still the player can bid at point 1/n and get his incentive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Hence, all the players would wish to stay at equilibrium and collect the pieces(1/n,1/n,....,1/n).</p>","uid":"i4tvrtkectm61"}],"nr":113,"tags":["other","student"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-03-21T18:31:45Z","data":"i7jcr2j2mr2b7","uid":"i4tvrtkectm61"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["hw1"],"status":"active","created":"2015-03-21T18:34:28Z","unique_views":0,"children":[],"id":"i7jcuk96ww71sl","config":{"feed_groups":"instr_i4tcy4uxm5i3sk,hz0s0y8f59pms"},"history":[{"created":"2015-03-21T18:34:28Z","anon":"no","subject":"assignment one","content":"<p>Envy free mechanism for n=3\u00a0</p>\n<p>1.player one cuts the cake in three pieces which are equal according to him.</p>\n<p>2.then player two can either pass the partitions or he can choose two largest parts and make them equal by trimming \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a small part out of the largest to make the two parts equal.</p>\n<p>3.player 3 can also pass the partitions or he can also trim one of the two parts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>case 1:- player2 as well as player 3 passed the partitions\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0this case is simple one can choose his part in any order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>case 2:- player 2 doesnt not see all the three parts equal so he will choose two largest parts and make them equal by trimming a small part say L out of the largest. in this case the order of choosing will be 3 2 1. the choosing of cake after trimming is envy free.if player 3 didnt\u00a0choose the partition after triming then player 2 must choose that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>case 3:-now suppose player 2 passes the partitions but player 3\u00a0dont see the partitions equal then he will choose 2 largest parts and make them equal by triming\u00a0and then order of choosing will be 2 3 1. if player 2 didnt choose the partition after trimming then player 3 must choose that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>the trimming then can be divided by the player who didnt\u00a0get trimmed part and is other than player 1 and the order of choosing will be suppose player 2 got partition after trimming then 3 will cut the trimmed portion in three equal parts and the order will be 2 1 3.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>example and proof :-</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let&#39;s call the three people Alice, Bob, and Charlie.</p>\n<p>1.

Because if any player will cut the piece in such a way that it is not fair, it will cost to him. So all Kids will Choose there Best Response Strategies.Every kid strategy is not\u00a0 dependent on the\u00a0 strategy played by other kids.So this social choice function is implementable in Weakly Dominated Strategy Equilibrium.So that&#39;s why it is <strong>DSIC.</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.piazza.com/class/i4tcy4uxm5i3sk?cid=89\">other</a> </div>","bucket_order":7,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T06:13:26Z","bucket_name":"Week 3/15 - 3/21","uid":"hz0s0y0vz1m4","no_upvotes":0},{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-22T06:16:42Z","anon":"no","children":[{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-22T06:24:57Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7k288slbta37s","data":null,"subject":"<p>True,the above procedure for 3-kids is both fair and envy -free..</p>","bucket_order":7,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T06:24:57Z","bucket_name":"Week 3/15 - 3/21","uid":"hz0s0yezx0onl"},{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-22T07:03:23Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7k3lo6cv8w4km","data":null,"subject":"<p>Yes, This work fine with total no pieces = n! .</p>","bucket_order":7,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T07:03:23Z","bucket_name":"Week 3/15 - 3/21","uid":"hz0s0y5fjlnmg"},{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-22T13:25:13Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7kh8pa16kt51r","data":null,"subject":"<p>yes,it will work correctly but there is too much pieces.....</p>","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T13:25:13Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"hz0s0y3rt63ma"},{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-03-22T16:52:25Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7kon64j7jo6a8","data":null,"subject":"<p>&#64;Hariom All the n-player envy free mechanisms that we have encountered so far in the discussion has too many pieces. \u00a0If you know any mechanism with less pieces please let us\u00a0know. \u00a0That would be great !</p>","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T16:52:25Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"hz0s0ygz1r3nv"}],"id":"i7k1xmm7tc91ad","data":null,"no_answer":1,"subject":"<p><strong>Cake cutting game for 3 players</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#39;s say we have 3 players {1,2,3}</p>\n<p>firstly, we will say 1st player to cut the cake into 3 equal pieces, then we&#39;ll say other two players to choose any one piece of their choice.

Player 1 cuts the cake into 3 pieces (that he considers to be the same size).\nStep 2. Player 2 is given the choice of either passing (which he does if he thinks two or more pieces are tied for largest), or trimming a piece from (the largest) one of the three pieces (to create a tie for largest). If Player 2 trimmed a piece, then the trimmings are named L, for &#34;leftover,&#34; and set aside.\nStep 3. Players 3, 2, and 1, in that order, choose a piece (that they consider to be at least tied for largest) from among the 3 pieces, one of which may have been trimmed in Step 2. If Player 2 did not pass in Step 2, then he is required to choose the piece he trimmed if Player 3 did not.\n                Notice that only part of the cake has been allocated. This yields a partition {X1, X2, X3, L} of the cake such that {X1,X2, X3} iS an envy-free partial allocation. The lack of envy is true of: Player 3, because he chooses first; Player 2, because he made at least two pieces tied for largest, and so at least one of them will still be available after Player 3 chooses his piece; and Player 1, because he made all three pieces of size 1/3, and the trimmed one has definitely been taken by either Player 3 or Player 2.\nStep 4. If Player 2 passed at Step 2, we are done. Otherwise, either Player 2 or Player 3 received the trimmed piece, and the other received an untrimmed piece. Whichever player received the untrimmed piece now divides L into 3 pieces (that he considers to be the same size). Call this player the &#34;cutter&#34; and the other the &#34;non-cutter.&#34;\n                We will refer to Player 1 as having an irrevocable advantage over the non-cutter. The point is that, since the non-cutter received the trimmed piece, Player 1 will not envy the non-cutter, regardless of how L is later divided among the three.\nStep 5. The three pieces into which L is divided are now chosen by the players in the order: non-cutter first; Player 1 second; cutter third. (Each chooses a piece at least tied for largest among those available to him when it is his turn to choose.)\n                At this point, the entire cake has been allocated. Since the non-cutter chooses his piece of L first, he experiences no envy. Player 1 does not envy the non-cutter, since he had an irrevocable advantage over him, and Player 1 does not envy the cutter, because he is choosing his piece of L before the cutter does. Finally, the cutter experiences no envy since he divided L into three equal pieces.\n \nFor n = 4 and more \nFor n=4, Player1, cuts the cake into five equal-looking pieces. He passes them to Player2, who trims two at most to create a three-way tie for largest in her eyes. She sets the trimmings aside and gives the five pieces to Player3, who trims one at most to create a two-way tie for largest in his eyes. Player4, now selects the piece she likes best. Choosing proceeds in the reverse order from cutting, with the proviso that anyone who trimmed one or more pieces must take one of them if any are still available when it&#39;s his or her turn to choose. The extra piece to begin with assures that no player gets second-best. If someone takes a piece she likes before it&#39;s her turn to choose, an equivalent piece or better always remains on the table. According to a formula that Brams and Taylor developed, Player1 must cut the cake into at least 2(n-2) &#43;1 pieces at the start. This amounts to nine pieces for five players, 17 pieces for six, and so on. Player1 has to cut all these extra pieces to make sure that, when he finally gets to choose at the end, there will be a piece left that hasn&#39;t been either trimmed or chosen by one of the many other players.","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-03-22T16:45:10Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"i4w838xik0z4pu","no_upvotes":0}],"id":"i7jgpcwigoa1z1","config":{"feed_groups":"hzs7j2ra4m63xg,instr_i4tcy4uxm5i3sk","anon_group":1},"history":[{"created":"2015-04-02T22:06:20Z","anon":"no","subject":"Discussion on assignment 1","content":"<p>Here you are free to discuss your ideas on assignment 1.

I","content":"<p>&#34;solution to assignment &#34;</p>\n<p>For 3 player <br /><br />//for this problem i thought following solution <br />algorithm 1<br />let players be A,B,C<br />A first cut the pieces in three equal parts then <br />B is asked to chose a piece for C , if C accepts <br />then that piece is given to C. if C does not accept<br />\u00a0then that piece is forced to B. for next round <br />\u00a0remaining players are A and one of B and C. in this <br />\u00a0case A chooses for other player and if other player <br />\u00a0accepts the piece then that piece is given to that <br />\u00a0player else that piece is forced to A. remaining <br />\u00a0piece is taken by the remaining player.<br /><br />algo 2 <br />this algorithm taken from [1]<br /><br />\u00a0A makes the cuts, we ask<br />B to pick his top two pieces \u2013 let\u2019s call these S1 , S2 \u2013 and then trim the largest piece S1 to<br />make it equal in size to S2 . We call this trimmed piece S1_dash and the remaining trimmings T.<br />If we now consider the pieces S1_dash , S2 , S3 , the conditions for a perfect matching apply, and<br />we can allocate the pieces in an envy-free manner. A minor detail here is that B must<br />pick S1_dash over S2 and S3 and S2 over S3, which can easily be arranged as follows.<br />first preference of choosing is given to C. if C chooses S1_dash then B will choose S2 and A will choose S3 <br />which is conflict free distribution. if C chooses S2 then B will choose S1_dash and A will choose S3 <br />which is conflict free distribution. which is conflict free distribution.if C chooses S2 then B will<br />\u00a0choose S1_dash and A will choose S2 which is conflict free distribution. which is also conflict free distribution.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br /><br />But what about T ? We could recurse, but this process could continue forever (remember<br />that cake is continuous). We need a different approach to dividing T.<br />We know something about T. It was taken from S1 , which A believes to be equal to<br />the piece he/she got. So if the person who got S1_dash gets any part of T, A doesn\u2019t care. Let\u2019s say<br />that B got the trimmed piece. Then we have C divide T into three equal parts. B<br />picks first, followed by A. B is envy-free by virtue of picking first. A is envy free<br />because she picks before C. Finally, C is envy-free because the pieces are equal in<br />value by her valuation. <br /><br />generalized algorithm for k player<br /><br />Algo 1 this algorithm taken from [1]<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Recursively divide the cake among k \u2212 1 players.<br />Each of the k \u2212 1 players divides their piece into k equal parts.<br />Player k chooses a part from each of the other k \u2212 1 players.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Algo 2 this algorithm taken from [1]<br /><br /><br />this\u00a0 method that divides a cake fairly among k players with a finite number of cuts.<br />It works in k rounds, with each round ending when one player gets a piece. Assume the<br />players are ordered arbitrarily from 1 to k. <br /><br />Algorithm 1 A single round of trimming<br />----------------------------------------<br />Player 1 cuts a piece of size 1/k.<br />for i = 2 to k \u2212 1 do<br />Player i trims the current piece if they think it\u2019s too big.

These applications include viral marketing,<br /> influence maximization, and crowdsourcing for geosensing. Design of<br /> incentive strategies plays a crucial role in deriving optimal performance<br /> in these applications.\u00a0 The thesis addresses the following problems.<br /> <br /> (1) Optimal Timing of Incentive Strategies on\u00a0 Social Networks:<br /> The reach of a new product in a population can be influenced by<br /> offering (a) direct incentives to influence the buying behavior of<br /> potential buyers and (b) referral rewards to exploit the impact of<br /> social influence in inducing a purchasing decision. The seller is<br /> interested in finding an optimal mix of these incentive programs. We<br /> report results on the structure of optimal strategies for the seller with<br /> significant practical implications.<br /> <br /> (2) Optimal Control Strategies for Social Influence (SI) Marketing:<br /> We investigate four SI strategies, namely, recommendation<br /> programs, referral programs, consumer reviews, and campaigns on on-line<br /> forums. The campaign is assumed to be of finite duration<br /> and the objective is to maximize profit over the campaign duration. For<br /> each SI strategy, we focus on its timing and resolve key practical<br /> questions.<br /> <br /> (3) Truthful Tractable Mechanisms with Applications to Crowdsourcing:<br /> We focus on crowdsourcing applications that involve specialized<br /> tasks for which the planner hardly has any idea about crowdworkers&#39; costs,<br /> for example, tagging geographical regions with air<br /> pollution levels or severity level of Ebola like disease. The mechanisms<br /> have to be robust to untruthful bidding from the crowdworkers. In our<br /> work, we propose tractable allocation algorithms that are monotone,<br /> leading to design of truthful mechanisms that can be successfully deployed<br /> in such applications.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ALL ARE WELCOME</p>","uid":"gyoeyz7p8511js"}],"nr":123,"tags":["instructor-note","other"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-03-25T04:07:00Z","data":"i7o7mea9y576gh","uid":"gyoeyz7p8511js"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[{"us":false,"name":"Swapnil Dhamal","admin":true,"email":"swapnil.dhamal@gmail.com","facebook_id":null,"id":"gyoeyz7p8511js","role":"ta","admin_permission":5,"photo":null},{"us":false,"name":"D Raghuram Bharadwaj","admin":false,"email":"raghu.bharadwaj@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"hz0s0xzzdqnm1","role":"student","photo":"1421752897_35.png"},{"us":false,"name":"Anupam Sanghi","admin":false,"email":"anupam.sanghi@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"hz0s0y2wd5vm7","role":"student","photo":null},{"us":false,"name":"Vamshi Pasunuru","admin":false,"email":"vamshi.pasunuru@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"hz0s0ye67nzni","role":"student","photo":null},{"us":false,"name":"Yogesh","admin":false,"email":"yogesh.bhosale@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"hznxpxh0x5i3l1","role":"student","photo":null},{"us":false,"name":"Shinjini Biswas","admin":false,"email":"shinjini.biswas@csa.iisc.ernet.in","facebook_id":null,"id":"i4tvru50h7m6h","role":"student","photo":null}],"type":"note","folders":["exam"],"status":"active","created":"2015-03-25T08:12:18Z","unique_views":29,"children":[],"id":"i7ogduyqosd4ay","config":{},"history":[{"created":"2015-03-25T08:12:18Z","anon":"no","subject":"Regarding Tutorial Class today.","content":"<p>Dear all,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today the tutorial classes for doubts and problems in mechanism design is going to be conducted in Room no. 117, from 6:30 pm onward.

These types of mechanism comes under Groves mechanism which induce truthful revelation by individual since the individual is under loss by lieing  and he is better of by telling truth. Fairy tale stories like wood cutter and the river angel also express truthful revelation to be DSIC under such a SCF and is thereby a type of Groves mechanism where collusion is considered to be absent.

Let player 1 divide the cake into N equal size pieces. <br />\u00a0 <br />2.) Now there will be cake allocation, as player one was given the chance to cut the cake he is out of the allocation process. <br />The allocation mechanism works as follows: <br />a.) Construct a bipartite graph of remaining N-1 players(except 1) and N cake pieces, by connecting nodes of each player to the nodes corresponding to cake in which each player is interested in. <br />b.) Now compute maximal matching of this graph. If each player is covered in this matching, we are done. This means a reasonable allocation is possible. If there are some players which are not matched then go to step c. <br />c.) We can come up with a set of players U and a set of cakes V, where U consists of all unmatched player along with a few matched players and V consists of some of the cake pieces. These sets U and V are such that every player in set U is not interested in any cake piece outside of V and V does not contain any vertex which has an edge with any vertex outside of U. \u00a0<br />d.) Constructing U and V in the above manner ensures us that we can make the allocations according to the edges outside of sets U and V. Also if there is any free cake outside V we can allocate that to player-1. <br />e.) After we haves made the allocation we need to repeat this process for remaining players and cake pieces after making necessary trimmings. <br />\u00a0 <br />We can also show that this procedure necessarily reduces the number of players in each iteration. <br />\u00a0 <br />The nature of this equilibrium is DSIC as irrespective of others players moves our moves are not effected. </p>","uid":"hysl9725cxj255"}],"nr":188,"tags":["hw1","student","unanswered"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-01T13:07:47Z","data":"i7yr0swwod84h6","uid":"hysl9725cxj255"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["exam"],"status":"active","created":"2015-04-01T13:52:17Z","unique_views":57,"children":[{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-01T14:02:33Z","anon":"no","children":[{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-01T15:40:49Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7ywhlzry8c312","data":null,"subject":"<p>&#34;Intent to win&#34; was missing.

Smith has been in excellent form in the last few months and turned it on in style in Sydney, smashing 11 fours and 2 sixes.<br /><br />2)After Smith&#39;s innings, Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner came to the party for the hosts. Johnson blasted an unbeaten 27 off just 9 deliveries after Faulkner&#39;s 12-ball 21. Their cameos helped the Aussies score 57 runs in the last five overs to ensure they surpassed 300 runs.<br /><br />3)Mohammad Shami had been in superb form throughout this World Cup, taking 17 wickets. However, he had an off-day in this match, overdoing the short stuff on a good batting track. The pacer wicketless in his 10 overs and conceded 68 runs.<br /><br />4)Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma got India&#39;s chase off to a solid start, putting on 76. However, the batting line-up failed to capitalise on it in the face of some disciplined bowling by the Aussies. Virat Kohli, who is usually excellent in big-run chases, was dismissed for 1, while Ajinkya Rahane (44 off 68 balls) got bogged down in the middle overs.<br /><br />5)MS Dhoni losing the toss was factor on a flat batting pitch at the SCG.

He had given India a quick start. The momentum was with India. The moment Virat Kohli walked in, he looked to play himself in. In the\u00a0 ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, he did not fire after the game against Pakistan. He was due, he faced a tight over from Hazlewood before Johnson came on.\u00a0 The bouncer came and Kohli went for it, but he failed to get any connection and top-edged it to Haddin behind the wickets.<br /><br />\u00a0No partnerships in the chase:\u00a0 Chasing a score like 329, you need to build partnerships to keep yourself in the game. After the 76-run opening stand, India managed to stitch just one more 50-run stand. Australia had a huge 182-run stand which ensured they did not need many more. But India chasing a mammoth total, needed to put their head down, stitch partnerships. After the opening stand, the next one came between MS Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane, by which time the game was already beyond India\u2019s reach. <br /><br />Over-bowling the short ball: Indians had used the short ball well so far in the tournament. They used it instead of wasting it, unlike the events in the second semi-final. There were\u00a0 a lot of needless, wayward short ones which were also attempted at the wrong time and the Australian batsmen made merry. There was not much bounce, but all the three Indian pacers kept testing the middle of the pitch. Yes, they did get wickets off it but they paid a heavy price for bowling that short as even at the death, they tried bowling short balls and Johnson too cashed in and scoring a differential knock.<br /><br />Ravindra Jadeja:\u00a0 Ravindra Jadeja did not have a very good run in the World Cup, and his figures today also showed why India failed to breakthrough at regular intervals against Australia.\u00a0 There was some help on the wicket for the spinners, but he failed to extract any. His figures of 10-0-56-0 did not help India maintain pressure on the Australians. With the bat, when he needed to stay there with Dhoni, he never seemed to be in control and was run-out for a 17-ball 16.</p>","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-01T18:28:22Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"i4xx4jt1xgk41d","no_upvotes":0},{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-01T18:37:08Z","anon":"no","children":[{"type":"feedback","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-02T03:57:06Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7zmshambbb4fn","data":null,"subject":"<p>this answer is conditional.</p>\n<p></p>","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-02T03:57:06Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"hz0s0y8f59pms"}],"id":"i7z2scvqxy14sj","data":null,"no_answer":1,"subject":"<p>Because Austrailia is a much better side than India .</p>","bucket_order":5,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-01T18:37:08Z","bucket_name":"Last week","uid":"i56t3eu05vv2u5","no_upvotes":0},{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-01T20:41:06Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i7z77ro1exb1f0","data":null,"no_answer":1,"subject":"<p>Smith is always good against short pitch deliveries.

Now player 2 will cut the larger fraction of the cake into exactly two equal halves, else he&#39;ll get a smaller piece then the 3rd player. Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 equal halves and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake). But now player 1 gets to choose the piece that he had cut himself, which is the smallest one and thus he&#39;s not satisfied. Thus he won&#39;t cut a piece which is smaller than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2: P3 cuts a piece which is greater than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Say he cuts 0.4. Now the player 2 will cut the cake based on how player 1 has cut. He cuts the remaining portion( 0.6 of the cake) that one of the pieces match the larger piece cut by player 1, i.e, into 0.4 &#43; 0.2, Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 halves, one of which was exactly equal to the largest piece and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake). But now player 1 gets the piece which is the smallest one and thus he&#39;s not satisfied. Thus he won&#39;t cut a piece which is greater than 1/3 of the cake. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus Player 1 cuts a fraction of the cake exactly equal to 1/3 of the cake. And then player 2 cuts the remaining into 2 equal halves, else any other strategy will leave him with a smaller piece and and thus agitated. So the above mechanism ensures satisfaction of all the players.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.) n player cake cutting problem</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mechanism: We simply generalize the above mechanism to the n player cake cutting problem. Player 1 cuts x1 fraction  of the cake, then player 2 cuts x2 fraction of the remaining cake and so on... Then the last player Pn gets to choose first and then the player n - 1 chooses and so on...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Claim : The above mechanism ensures the satisfaction of all the players when each one of them cuts 1/n fraction out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We prove this by the principle of mathematical induction:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Base Case: The 2 player game ensures satisfaction when the above mechanism is followed. Therefore the base case is satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Induction Hypothesis: Consider the above claim ensures satisfaction of all the players in a k player cake cutting problem. We go on to show that induction hypothesis implies the satisfaction of all the players in k &#43; 1 player cake cutting problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 1: P1 cuts x1 &lt; 1/k &#43;1 of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. And each one of them cut the remaining portion into k equal parts and by the induction hypotheses all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2: P1 cuts x1 &gt; 1/ (k &#43; 1) of the cake.\u00a0 Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts. But now the player k &#43; 1 gets the largest piece which is equal to x1 and the rest of the players get smaller pieces including player 1. Thus he does not cut x1 &gt; 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus player 1 cuts the fraction x1 = 1/(k&#43;1) of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts and in the end all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Equilibrium of the above game:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly the above mechanism is not DSIC, as what player 2 cuts depends on what player 1&#39;s cut is and so on.</p>\n<p>This mechanism is easily BIC as its best response to cut out a 1/n fraction if everybody is doing the same.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","uid":"i4y18rf5nm02uf"}],"nr":193,"tags":["exam","student"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-02T16:08:06Z","data":"i80cwjyx4nm3fb","uid":"i4y18rf5nm02uf"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["hw1"],"status":"active","created":"2015-04-02T19:17:17Z","unique_views":41,"children":[{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-03T11:00:00Z","anon":"no","children":[{"type":"feedback","d-bucket":"Yesterday","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-03T13:12:03Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i81m2080skc12v","data":null,"subject":"<p>It was not decided then.

Because, this is not the best strategy if all others are not playing their true partitions. (Recalling NASC for DSIC: the scf is DSIC iff for each agent i (i=1,2..n), it is always a best response strategy to report it&#39;s true type\u00a0$$\\theta_i $$ irrespective of the reports of other players.). For eg: if all players except 1. decides to play $$\\delta$$ which is $$&lt; \\frac{1}{n}$$, then the best response strategy for player 1 is not playing $$y_i$$ but more than that.<br /><br />This is\u00a0a BIC equilibrium because, for each player-i, whenever the other agents report their types truthfully, it is a best response\u00a0<em>in expectation\u00a0</em>for agent i to report his true type\u00a0$$\\theta_i $$.</p>","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"nr":256,"tags":["instructor-note","other"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-02T21:13:29Z","data":"i80nta8hboa1tk","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},{"type":"followup","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-03T19:34:39Z","to":"i80nta8eiyn1tj","uid":"hyskikjob6b1y9"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":1},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["other"],"status":"active","created":"2015-04-02T21:14:21Z","unique_views":1,"children":[{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-05T06:28:31Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i842iqyqxuyy","data":null,"no_answer":1,"subject":"<p><b>8</b></p>","bucket_order":2,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-05T06:28:31Z","bucket_name":"Today","uid":"hznxpxbs3z23ks","no_upvotes":0}],"id":"i80nue6vu1727o","config":{"bypass_email":1,"feed_groups":"hznxpxbs3z23ks,i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},"history":[{"created":"2015-04-02T21:14:21Z","anon":"no","subject":"40 Ramit Hansda","content":"<p>The solution in the case of 3 players is as follows</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1.

Partly, in the case where B has trimmed one of<br />the piece and the trimming is set aside. Otherwise, it is wholly and we are done. In either case we need<br />to prove the allocation was envy-free.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 i.

He sets</p>\n<p>the trimmings aside and gives the five pieces to C, who trims at-most one to create a two-way tie\u00a0<br />for largest in his eyes. D, the fourth kid, now selects the piece which he thinks is the best. Choosing\u00a0<br />proceeds in the reverse order from cutting, with the condition that anyone who trimmed one or more</p>\n<p>pieces must take one of them if any are still available when it is his turn to choose. The extra piece to</p>\n<p>begin with assures that no kid gets second-best.

Kid-1 will cut the cake into 3 pieces which he considers to be of equal sizes.\u00a0Let&#39;s call these pieces $$C_1, C_2, C_3$$.</p>\n<p><strong>(2)</strong>\u00a0Then all the pieces are passed to kid-2. If he thinks that there is a piece that is larger than two other pieces (say\u00a0$$C_1$$), then\u00a0he cuts (trims) the large piece to make it equal to second larger piece. Let&#39;s call the original piece after trimming\u00a0$$C_{11}$$ and the other trimming $$C_{12}$$.</p>\n<p><strong>(3)</strong>\u00a0Then, kid-3 is given the chance to pick one of the pieces from $$C_{11}, C_2, C_3$$. (This way kid-3 is sure of getting the largest piece of cake. So, he is happy.)</p>\n<p><strong>(4)</strong>\u00a0If kid-3 doesn&#39;t pick $$C_{11}$$, then kid-2 is required to choose $$C_{11}$$. (This way kid-2 is happy because he knows that there were two largest pieces and one of them must be there and it must be $$C_{11}$$. So, he is happy.)</p>\n<p><strong>(5)</strong>\u00a0The remaining piece is chosen by kid-1. (Kid-1 is happy because he know that all pieces are of equal sizes.)</p>\n<p><strong>(6)</strong>\u00a0If, in step-2 kid-2 did not trim any piece then we are done. Otherwise either kid-2 or kid-3 received the trimmed piece $$C_{11}$$. Let&#39;s call this kid\u00a0<strong>kid_trim</strong>\u00a0and other kid\u00a0<b>kid_full.</b></p>\n<p><strong>(7)</strong>\u00a0Now, kid_full is given the chance to divide $$C_{12}$$ into three equal size pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>(8)</strong>\u00a0Of these three pieces, kids choose one of the piece in the order kid_trim, kid-1, kid_full. (kid_trim is happy because he gets the first chance to chose from. Kid-1 is happy because he know that kid_trim will always have smaller part than himself and he is given the chance is choose before kid_full. kid_full is happy because he divided $$C_{12}$$ into three equal pieces).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This mechanism is envy-free and hence proportional, as every kid has received a piece that he/she would not swap with any other kid. This mechanism can be generalized to the case for n kids where n = 3, 4, 5, ... Suppose there are 4 kids. Kid-1 will cut the cake into 5 equal size pieces. Kid-2 then trims 2 pieces to create a tie for largest among 3 pieces. Kid-3 then trims 1 piece, creating a tie for largest. Now, the kids choose in the order: kid-4, kid-3, kid-2, kid-1 with the middle two players required to take a piece they trimmed if one is available. Now, all the kids thinks his/her piece is at least as large as other pieces and hence all kids will be happy with the distribution of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This equilibrium is DSIC and hence BIC because if any kid deviates from it&#39;s strategy then he/she may get smaller piece of cake. Every kid is playing a strategy that is as good as other strategies for that kid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong>\u00a0S. J. Brams and A. D.

Consider a kid who hasn&#39;t raised his/her hand. That must mean he/she doesn&#39;t think that mother has reached\u00a01/n\u00a0point of the cake. That must mean even if all\u00a0(n-1)\u00a0other kids raise their hands before this kid, as per his/her valuation, there must remain &gt;=\u00a01 -(n-1)/n\u00a0that is &gt;= 1/n\u00a0piece of cake left.

It is no longer best response for the rest of the kids to raise the hand at 1/n\u00a0of original size.To see this consider the last 2 kids. Since at least one of the kid raised hand before 1/n, the remaining piece of cake has f &gt; 2/n\u00a0fraction of original cake.

We divide the algorithm to two stages and for each one we argue that the stage is envy-free for the players. Initially we will create an envy-free(fair) division in\u00a0which we have some extra &#34;trimmings&#34;.

It is envy-free to B since she has two equally-favorite pieces, to pick. And it is envy-free to A since she split things equally in the first place, so the only slice she might not want is T, but the protocol guarantees she doesn&#39;t have to take it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Stage II</strong><br /><br /></p>\n<p><em>Deal with the trimmings</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now we note the status-quo : A will remain envy-free regardless of the amount of cake that we give to the person who received piece T (since she originally cut the cake into equal thirds).

Now we have 3 players. A continuous mechanism can be used for the allocation of pieces as follows.</p>\n<p>We have a cake and a knife. Now, the knife is moved from left most corner to right most corner. During this continuous movement, the player has give the signal (say\u00a0they use the word &#39;STOP&#39; or some alarm buzz)\u00a0to pause the knife\u00a0movement. Then that portion of cake is cut and immediately allocated to player whose delivers the signal.</p>\n<p>So, now we are left with other larger piece of cake and 2 players. The approach\u00a0discussed in the\u00a0class can be used to allocate\u00a0pieces of cake to 2 players.</p>\n<p>Let Fi be the function of fraction\u00a0pieces of cake</p>\n<p>A1, A2, A3 be the players</p>\n<p>X1,X2,X3 be the pieces of cake.</p>\n<p>It can seen that F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)=1/3</p>\n<p>As the knife is moved from left to right the players may bid immediately or else other payers may bid for that, so</p>\n<p>if x be the player who first delivers signal, then</p>\n<p>Fx(X1)=1/3.</p>\n<p>Then for the other 2 players, the cake is split into 2 equal halves as seen in class. so,</p>\n<p>F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)=1/3.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Generalisation for n players</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The same approach can be extended to the n players.</p>\n<p>Say, there are n players. The knife is moved from left to right corner. When the first player gives the signal the piece is allocated to him. The same process is repeated again. The knife movement is started from left to right, the one who first delivers the signal first is allocated with the piece.</p>\n<p>The process is repeated for n-1 times, then cake pieces are allocated for n-1 players and last piece is allocated for the left over player.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As, seen above for the 3 players, the same can be generalised for n players in a iterative way. Hence</p>\n<p>F1(X1)=F2(X2)=F3(X3)........Fn(Xn)=1/n.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>The equilibrium is DSIC(Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible).</strong></p>\n<p>No matter even if other players deviate from the equilibrium point, the player is guaranteed to get an incentive of at least\u00a0<strong>1/n.</strong></p>\n<p>Let us assume some player &#39;i&#39; deviates and bids/signals when knife is less than 1/n point, still other players are guaranteed atleast &gt;=1/n.</p>\n<p>Let us assume some players being greedy do not bid/signal at point 1/n.

Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 equal halves and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake).

He cuts the remaining portion( 0.6 of the cake) that one of the pieces match the larger piece cut by player 1, i.e, into 0.4 &#43; 0.2, Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 halves, one of which was exactly equal to the largest piece and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake).

So the above mechanism ensures satisfaction of all the players.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.) n player cake cutting problem</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mechanism: We simply generalize the above mechanism to the n player cake cutting problem. Player 1 cuts x1 fraction of the cake, then player 2 cuts x2 fraction of the remaining cake and so on... Then the last player Pn gets to choose first and then the player n - 1 chooses and so on...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Claim : The above mechanism ensures the satisfaction of all the players when each one of them cuts 1/n fraction out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We prove this by the principle of mathematical induction:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Base Case: The 2 player game ensures satisfaction when the above mechanism is followed. Therefore the base case is satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Induction Hypothesis: Consider the above claim ensures satisfaction of all the players in a k player cake cutting problem. We go on to show that induction hypothesis implies the satisfaction of all the players in k &#43; 1 player cake cutting problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 1: P1 cuts x1 &lt; 1/k &#43;1 of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. And each one of them cut the remaining portion into k equal parts and by the induction hypotheses all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2: P1 cuts x1 &gt; 1/ (k &#43; 1) of the cake.\u00a0 Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts. But now the player k &#43; 1 gets the largest piece which is equal to x1 and the rest of the players get smaller pieces including player 1. Thus he does not cut x1 &gt; 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus player 1 cuts the fraction x1 = 1/(k&#43;1) of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts and in the end all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Equilibrium of the above game:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly the above mechanism is not DSIC, as what player 2 cuts depends on what player 1&#39;s cut is and so on.</p>\n<p>This mechanism is easily BIC as its best response to cut out a 1/n fraction if everybody is doing the same.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"nr":313,"tags":["instructor-note","other"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-06T10:16:31Z","data":"i85q3t6rsr63i0","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},{"type":"followup","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-07T16:42:27Z","to":"i85q3t6o5fb3hz","uid":"hz0s0y5fjlnmg"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["other"],"status":"active","created":"2015-04-06T10:16:42Z","unique_views":1,"children":[{"type":"followup","folders":[],"created":"2015-04-08T08:06:14Z","anon":"no","children":[],"id":"i88gbzkhqfy5n5","data":null,"no_answer":1,"subject":"<p>9</p>","bucket_order":2,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-08T08:06:14Z","bucket_name":"Today","uid":"i4tvrug096l6w","no_upvotes":0}],"id":"i85q41xp5cp3j3","config":{"bypass_email":1,"feed_groups":"i4tvrug096l6w,i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},"history":[{"created":"2015-04-06T10:16:42Z","anon":"no","subject":"srimithra vemula 59","content":"<p><strong>Cake Cutting Problem</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>1. 3 player cake cutting problem.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mechanism: The first player P1, cuts a fraction of Cake exactly equal to 1/3 of it.

Now from player 2&#39;s perspective, this is <strong>(0.4, 0.4, 0.2)</strong>. But for player 1 and player 3 sees it as <strong>(0.33.., 0.4, 0.266..)</strong>. Now player 3 takes 2nd piece (0.4) and player 2 takes 1st piece ( actually it is 0.33.. but player 2 thinks it is also 0.4). Player 1 ends up with the 3rd piece (0.266..).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not fair for player1, even though he expressed his true valuation (not even getting 1/3) and every player should think they get at least (1/n) to become a fair strategy.</p>","bucket_order":2,"config":{},"updated":"2015-04-06T14:52:56Z","bucket_name":"Today","uid":"hz0s0ygb1sjnr","no_upvotes":0}],"id":"i85qgrun7117r","config":{"bypass_email":1,"feed_groups":"hz0s0ygb1sjnr,i4tkrjjhv8hm6"},"history":[{"created":"2015-04-06T10:26:35Z","anon":"no","subject":"dheeraj 57","content":"<p><strong>Cake Cutting Problem</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>1. 3 player cake cutting problem.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mechanism: The first player P1, cuts a fraction of Cake exactly equal to 1/3 of it.

Then player 2 cuts the remaining cake into exactly half and then the third player, P3 gets to choose first and then 2nd player chooses and then the first player gets the leftover.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Claim: The above cutting mechanism ensures the satisfaction of all the 3 players.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proof:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 1: P1 cuts a piece which is less than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Say he cuts 0.2 portion of the cake, so the remaining cake left after player 1&#39;s cut equals 0.8 of the original cake. Now player 2 will cut the larger fraction of the cake into exactly two equal halves, else he&#39;ll get a smaller piece then the 3rd player. Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 equal halves and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake). But now player 1 gets to choose the piece that he had cut himself, which is the smallest one and thus he&#39;s not satisfied. Thus he won&#39;t cut a piece which is smaller than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2: P3 cuts a piece which is greater than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Say he cuts 0.4. Now the player 2 will cut the cake based on how player 1 has cut. He cuts the remaining portion( 0.6 of the cake) that one of the pieces match the larger piece cut by player 1, i.e, into 0.4 &#43; 0.2, Now the player 3 chooses the piece which is largest according to him( i.e., 0.4 of the cake) and is thus satisfied. Player 2 who picks next knows that he had cut the remaining portion into 2 halves, one of which was exactly equal to the largest piece and thus is satisfied( gets 0.4 of the cake). But now player 1 gets the piece which is the smallest one and thus he&#39;s not satisfied. Thus he won&#39;t cut a piece which is greater than 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus Player 1 cuts a fraction of the cake exactly equal to 1/3 of the cake. And then player 2 cuts the remaining into 2 equal halves, else any other strategy will leave him with a smaller piece and and thus agitated. So the above mechanism ensures satisfaction of all the players.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.) n player cake cutting problem</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mechanism: We simply generalize the above mechanism to the n player cake cutting problem. Player 1 cuts x1 fraction of the cake, then player 2 cuts x2 fraction of the remaining cake and so on... Then the last player Pn gets to choose first and then the player n - 1 chooses and so on...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Claim : The above mechanism ensures the satisfaction of all the players when each one of them cuts 1/n fraction out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We prove this by the principle of mathematical induction:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Base Case: The 2 player game ensures satisfaction when the above mechanism is followed. Therefore the base case is satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Induction Hypothesis: Consider the above claim ensures satisfaction of all the players in a k player cake cutting problem. We go on to show that induction hypothesis implies the satisfaction of all the players in k &#43; 1 player cake cutting problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 1: P1 cuts x1 &lt; 1/k &#43;1 of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. And each one of them cut the remaining portion into k equal parts and by the induction hypotheses all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2: P1 cuts x1 &gt; 1/ (k &#43; 1) of the cake.\u00a0 Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts. But now the player k &#43; 1 gets the largest piece which is equal to x1 and the rest of the players get smaller pieces including player 1. Thus he does not cut x1 &gt; 1/3 of the cake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus player 1 cuts the fraction x1 = 1/(k&#43;1) of the cake. Then the remaining portion of the cake and the rest of the players constitute the k player cake cutting problem. Where all of them cut the remaining cake into k equal parts and in the end all are satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Equilibrium of the above game:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly the above mechanism is not DSIC, as what player 2 cuts depends on what player 1&#39;s cut is and so on.</p>\n<p>This mechanism is easily BIC as its best response to cut out a 1/n fraction if everybody is doing the same.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"nr":349,"tags":["instructor-note","other"],"change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2015-04-06T10:31:25Z","data":"i85qmzjm2mo12s","uid":"i4tkrjjhv8hm6"}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer_followup":0},{"tag_good":[],"type":"note","folders":["exam"],"status":"active","created":"2015-04-07T10:38:06Z","unique_views":5,"children":[],"id":"i876bf3uc2h78l","config":{"feed_groups":"instr_i4tcy4uxm5i3sk,hz0s0xzzdqnm1"},"history":[{"created":"2015-04-09T05:07:13Z","anon":"no","subject":"Assignment 3","content":"<p><strong>Question 1</strong> :</p>\n<p>I consider following environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Number of players N \u00a0= \u00a0n ( &gt; 2 )</p>\n<p>Types ($$\\Theta $$) \u00a0of all players = [0, 100 ] \u00a0( natural numbers )</p>\n<p>Actions of all players,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$$b_{i}$$\u00a0 = [ 0, 100] ( natural numbers )</p>\n<p>Utility of player i = \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0$$u_{i}$$ = \u00a0$$\\Theta _{i}$$ -\u00a0$$b_{3}$$ \u00a0where\u00a0$$b_{3}$$ is the 3rd highest bid. - &gt; if Player i wins</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 = \u00a00, if player i loses</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(a) This mechanism is <strong>NOT</strong> DSIC .\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Suppose there are 3 players and their Types are \u00a020, 50, 80 .\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, Player 3 wins and he will be truthful.</p>\n<p>But Player 2 need not be truthful, he can bid a value of 90, WIN the game and get utility of (50 - 20), instead of 0 when he bids 50.
